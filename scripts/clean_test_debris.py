"""Remove rows the test suite wrote into the real database.

Background: the per-test schema isolation silently failed for one run (Supabase's
pooler drops the `options=-csearch_path=` startup parameter, so every test resolved
in `public`). Fixed in storage/database.py, but the rows it already wrote are still
there - and `outreach.yml` runs on a cron against this same database, so fake leads
are not merely untidy.

Prints what it would delete and exits. Pass --apply to actually delete.
