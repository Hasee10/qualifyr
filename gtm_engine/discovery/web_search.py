"""Web-search discovery (E2): find companies by what they DO, not just mapped storefronts.

Runs the offer's derived search queries through a web search (Brave, or keyless DuckDuckGo),
takes each result's own domain, drops directories/aggregators/social, and yields it as a
company for the pipeline to crawl, classify and judge. This is what lets an offer reach
software firms, service businesses and online-only brands that carry no OSM/Overture tag.

Honest by construction: it asserts only the domain (a real site the search returned) and a
name guessed from that domain; everything else the pipeline learns by crawling. The buyer/
vendor gate and the intent judge filter out competitors and non-buyers downstream."""
