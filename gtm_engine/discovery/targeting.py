"""Offer -> discovery targets (E1).

The reframe's promise is that you describe what you sell and the engine figures out where to
look. Until now that translation was done by the *user*, in OSM/Overture tag syntax: a
campaign with a great offer but no hand-picked categories discovered nothing. This turns the
offer into the categories to search, so discovery is driven by the offer, not by the user's
knowledge of map tags.

How it stays honest: categories come from a curated taxonomy when possible, or from a
validated niche fallback that checks against known-valid OSM tags. The deterministic path
matches sector keywords against the offer; the optional LLM refines which sectors apply.
When no sector matches, industries are mapped to valid OSM/Overture tags directly."""
